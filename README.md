### <p align="center">This is a [BodyHealth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bodyhealth) addon, not a standalone plugin!</p>
**<p align="center">It needs to go in `plugins/BodyHealth/addons/`, not `plugins/`!</p>**
</br>
<p align="center">This addon reverse-engineers Minecraft's damage reduction logic to some degree</br>and lets you alter it to, for example, only apply damage reduction</br>from armor that visually covers the affected body part.</p>
